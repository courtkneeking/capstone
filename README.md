### Run project 
```node server.js ```
```cd public ```
```ng build --watch ```
<http://localhost:3000/>

### Code Review, key files 
>> _server.js_ the project's backend starts the app and includes database relations and etc.

>> _/public/src/app/x/x.component.ts_
 includes functions for x component

>> _/public/src/app//x.service.ts_
 service can share data between front/back end or between components, using dependency injection

#### Writing about one or more of these files, about the data flow through them, or anything else you think could be better would be great. Thanks!
